# Button Triggering Asynchronous Function with Loader

This is a small project showing how to build a button with a loading icon while waiting for a response from an API. 

This project is part of the Advanced Basics for Web Course which can be found [here](https://github.com/werner33/AdvancedBasicsForWeb).

The project has two elements: a place to display a cat fact and a button to load a new random cat fact.
